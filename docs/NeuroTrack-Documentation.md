# NeuroTrack Technical Documentation

## Overview
NeuroTrack is an advanced mental health assessment platform that leverages machine learning algorithms to provide personalized insights and recommendations. The system uses a combination of validated psychological assessment tools and modern ML techniques to deliver accurate mental health predictions.

## Architecture

### Frontend Technologies
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Framer Motion for animations

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Assessments table
CREATE TABLE assessments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  total_score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  prediction_label TEXT NOT NULL,
  risk_level TEXT NOT NULL,
  model_confidence FLOAT NOT NULL
);

-- Category scores table
CREATE TABLE category_scores (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  assessment_id UUID REFERENCES assessments(id),
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  max_score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  percentage FLOAT NOT NULL
);
```

### Machine Learning Implementation

#### Data Preprocessing
1. Feature Engineering
   - Question responses are normalized to 0-1 range
   - Categorical variables are one-hot encoded
   - Missing values are handled using mean imputation

2. Feature Selection
   - Correlation analysis
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Feature importance ranking

#### Model Architecture

1. Random Forest Classifier
   - Number of trees: 100
   - Max depth: 10
   - Min samples split: 2
   - Min samples leaf: 1
   - Bootstrap: True

2. Support Vector Machine
   - Kernel: RBF
   - C: 1.0
   - Gamma: 'scale'
   - Class weight: 'balanced'

#### Model Training Process
1. Data splitting: 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test
2. Cross-validation: 5-fold
3. Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search
4. Model evaluation using confusion matrix and classification metrics

#### Model Selection Criteria
- Random Forest was chosen as the primary model due to:
  - Better handling of non-linear relationships
  - Feature importance interpretation
  - Robust to overfitting
  - Handles mixed data types well

- SVM serves as a backup model for:
  - High-dimensional spaces
  - Memory efficiency
  - Different kernel options

### API Endpoints

```typescript
// Assessment endpoints
POST /api/assessments/start
POST /api/assessments/submit
GET /api/assessments/:id
GET /api/assessments/history

// Analysis endpoints
GET /api/analysis/trends
GET /api/analysis/insights
GET /api/analysis/recommendations

// User endpoints
POST /api/users/register
POST /api/users/login
GET /api/users/profile
```

## Security Measures

1. Data Protection
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure storage of assessment results
   - Regular security audits

2. Access Control
   - Role-based access control
